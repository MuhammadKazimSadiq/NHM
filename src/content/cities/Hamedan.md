descriptionText: >
  Hamedan is one of the oldest cities in Iran—and the
  world—rooted in the ancient Median Empire. Known
  historically as Ecbatana, it holds archaeological and
  spiritual weight with landmarks like the Tomb of
  Avicenna and the Ganjnameh inscriptions.
  Surrounded by mountains, Hamedan offers a mix of
  history, myth, and natural beauty.
