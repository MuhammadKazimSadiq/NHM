  Kashan is a historic oasis city on the edge of the desert, known for its elegant
  Qajar-era houses, rosewater distilleries, and traditional Persian gardens such as
  Fin Garden. With its blend of architecture, history, and deep cultural roots,
  Kashan offers a quieter, more intimate look into Iran’s past. It is also a key
  stop for pilgrims and travelers on the route between Qum and Isfahan.
