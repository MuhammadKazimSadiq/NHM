  Qazvin once served as a capital of the Persian
  Empire and remains rich in historical significance. It's
  known for its stunning Safavid-era architecture, such
  as the Chehel Sotoun Pavilion and ancient mosques.
  Positioned between Tehran and the Caspian region,
  Qazvin is both a strategic crossroad and a cultural
  stronghold.
