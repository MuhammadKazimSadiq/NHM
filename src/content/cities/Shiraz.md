  Shiraz is the city of poets, gardens, and wine—
  renowned as the cultural heart of Iran. Home to the
  tombs of Hafez and Sa’di, it blends literary legacy
  with stunning sites like the Nasir al-Mulk “Pink”
  Mosque and the vast Eram Garden. Close to the
  ancient ruins of Persepolis, Shiraz is a gateway to
  Iran’s imperial past and a center of Persian identity.
